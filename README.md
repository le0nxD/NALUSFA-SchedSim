|---------|--------------|------------|
| P1      | 0            | 4          |
| P2      | 1            | 3          |
| P3      | 2            | 1          |

### SJF (Shortest Job First)

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time |
|---------|--------------|------------|

## ⚙️ Scheduling Algorithm Overview

### 🟢 FCFS (First Come First Serve)

- **Type:** Non-preemptive  
- **Logic:** Processes are executed in order of arrival  
- **Execution:**
  - Sorted by `arrivalTime`
  - CPU executes the next arrived process fully before moving on  
  - Handles idle time if no process is available

```ts
startTime = max(currentTime, arrivalTime)
completionTime = startTime + burstTime
turnaroundTime = completionTime - arrivalTime
waitingTime = turnaroundTime - burstTime
```

---

### 🔵 SJF (Shortest Job First)

- **Type:** Non-preemptive  
- **Logic:** Among available processes, the one with the shortest `burstTime` is selected  
- **Execution:**
  - Checks all arrived processes
  - Selects the shortest burst time
  - CPU idles if no process has arrived

---

### 🟣 Round Robin

- **Type:** Preemptive  
- **Logic:** Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum) in a cyclic order  
- **Execution:**
  - Processes are queued and given `quantum` time
  - If unfinished, they’re pushed back to the queue
  - Ensures fairness, handles process arrival dynamically

```ts
if (remainingTime <= quantum) complete
else reduce time and re-queue
```

- Tracks:
  - Start time
  - Completion time
  - Turnaround time
  - Waiting time
